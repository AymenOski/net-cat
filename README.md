# ðŸ§  TCPChat â€“ NetCat Clone in Go

## ðŸ“Œ Description

**TCPChat** is a simple group chat application that mimics the behavior of the famous `netcat (nc)` tool. This project implements a server-client architecture using TCP connections. It allows multiple clients to join a chat room and exchange messages in real-time.

The main goal is to understand and apply concepts like TCP networking, sockets, Go concurrency (goroutines, channels, mutexes), and how to handle client-server communication in an efficient and safe way.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- âœ… TCP server that listens for incoming client connections
- âœ… Each client has a unique name (e.g., user1234)
- âœ… Server broadcasts all received messages to all connected clients
- âœ… Server handles unexpected client disconnections gracefully
- âœ… Uses Go concurrency (goroutines) to manage multiple clients simultaneously
- âœ… Messages are timestamped
- âœ…Broadcast messages from one client to all others.
- âœ…Server supports clean shutdown using OS signals (Ctrl+C).
- âœ…Clients are notified when the server shuts down.
- âœ… Implemented `.log` file to track all connections and server status, including client notifications when the server shuts down.

## Files

- `server.go` - TCP server that handles multiple clients and clean shutdown.
- `client.go` - Simple TCP client to connect to the server.

## Usage

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
$ go run ./TCPChat/
```
Expected Output:
```
âžœ  net-cat git:(main) go run ./TCPChat 
Chat Server Started : server listening for connections on port 8989

ðŸ”´hosin has left the groupe chat.
ðŸ”´aymen has left the groupe chat.
^C
The server is closing
```

### 2. Connect as a Client (New Terminal)
```bash
$ nc localhost 8080
```
Expected Output:
```

## Default Settings
In `main.go`, you can configure:
```go
MaxConnections = 10 // Max connections count
Port = ":8989"      // Default port if the user didnt set
```

Feel free to modify these as per your requirements.

Enjoy chatting! ðŸ’¬ðŸš€
