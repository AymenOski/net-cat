# ðŸ§  TCPChat â€“ NetCat Clone in Go

## ðŸ“Œ Description

**TCPChat** is a simple group chat application that mimics the behavior of the famous `netcat (nc)` tool. This project implements a server-client architecture using TCP connections. It allows multiple clients to join a chat room and exchange messages in real-time.

The main goal is to understand and apply concepts like TCP networking, sockets, Go concurrency (goroutines, channels, mutexes), and how to handle client-server communication in an efficient and safe way.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- âœ… TCP server that listens for incoming client connections
- âœ… Each client has a unique name (e.g., user1234)
- âœ… Server broadcasts all received messages to all connected clients
- âœ… Server handles unexpected client disconnections gracefully
- âœ… Uses Go concurrency (goroutines) to manage multiple clients simultaneously
- âœ… Messages are timestamped
- âœ…Broadcast messages from one client to all others.
- âœ…Server supports clean shutdown using OS signals (Ctrl+C).
- âœ…Clients are notified when the server shuts down.

## Files

- `server.go` - TCP server that handles multiple clients and clean shutdown.
- `client.go` - Simple TCP client to connect to the server.

## How to Run

### Start the Server

```bash
go run ./TCPChat/
```

### Start Clients

In separate terminals:

```bash
nc localhost 2525
```

Enjoy chatting! ðŸ’¬ðŸš€
